# Bank-Churn-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a banking environment using Python. It includes end-to-end data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling to uncover insights and build reliable predictive models.

## ðŸ“Š Data Exploration and Analysis

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key features influencing customer churn.
- Evaluated relationships between variables, tested hypotheses, and identified customer behavior trends.
- Generated actionable insights to inform strategic business decisions.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization

- Built clear and engaging visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Highlighted churn patterns and correlations to support stakeholder understanding.
- Delivered insights in a visually accessible format to aid decision-making.

---

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning

- Built predictive models for classification (customer churn) using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier, and for regression (account balance) using Multiple Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor, tailored to business objectives.
- Performed feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features, and applied cross-validation to ensure robust model performance.
- Evaluated classification models using ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and F1-Score; assessed regression models using RÂ² and RMSE, and validated LINE assumptions (Linearity, Independence, Normality, Equal Variance) for linear regression.
